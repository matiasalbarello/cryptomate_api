module CryptomateApi
  # The Payments tool is designed to create payments in specific assets through a secure escrow wallet system.
  # To use this module, you will first need to set up your `payment_address` on the Management API. This address is where you want to receive your funds once the payment is complete.

  # Once you have set up your `payment_address`, you can use the Payments API to create payments in the following steps:

  # 1. Create a payment intent: is a representation of a payment that is being processed. To create a payment intent, you will need to specify the following information:
  #   a. The amount of the payment
  #   b. The address of the asset in which the payment is to be made (Check listed token API from this section)
  #   c. The blockchain where your assets exists (Check get blockchain from the Management API)
  # 2. Send the customer the address returned by this service.

  # Once the customer has completed the payment, you will receive a webhook notification (configurable in Management API).
  # This notification will contain the status of the payment.
